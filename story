It was a very nice day at school. First, I had to run to my locker. In homeroom class, we had a test on math and Jane got a
perfect score. I forgot my homework for history class, and the teacher was not mad! Next I had to quickly write a report about
dog, and it was so interesting. I read it to the class and it made everybody sleep. Lunch was the best part of the day, we ate
sadwiches with pizza. In art class, Tom spilled the milk all over my new painting and it turned out nice. Music class took
forever, I just wanted to hop through it. I asked for a pass to go to the computer lab, and I saw Jacob and Jessica talking in
the hall. My last class was computer, and we played with three new ipads. After school, I felt tired as I rode the bus home.
